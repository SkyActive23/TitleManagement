This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

# Title Management App
This app enables users to manage titles by adding, editing, and deleting them, provided they have a connected MetaMask wallet. Users can connect their wallet, view their titles, and manage them directly through the app interface.

### Getting Started
Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```
### Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd frontend
```
### Install Dependencies


```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```
or
```
pnpm install
```

### Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
 or
```
yarn dev

### Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### MetaMask Wallet Connection
For full access to title management features, users need to connect their MetaMask wallet. The app verifies the wallet connection and displays the relevant title management options if the wallet is connected.
